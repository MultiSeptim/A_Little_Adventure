"Few, even among the greatest dignitaries of the realm, know that Wesnoth's eastern borders extend far beyond the Eastmark Hills!\n"
"All began when the Queen Li'sar, newly established on the throne, organized a series of expeditions that circumnavigated the continent of Irdya to determine its extension and establish the conformation of his coasts. One of these expeditions, commanded by the Admiral Abelardo Gozman, left Elensefar in the spring of 520 YW, heading north. After a journey of almost 2 years, almost all of them spent making surveys and doing research in the cold seas of the north, Gozman reached the eastern coasts of the continent, and then a small bay, at the mouth of a river, inhabited by a little community of nereids.\n"
"The calculations made by Gozman made him suspect that the Bitter Swamp, that at the time represented the eastern limit of the human knowledge of the continent of Irdya, had to be, more or less, halfway between the eastern and the western coasts of the same continent. Then he chose a small group of men who, under the command of Captain Guberto Piegafetta and with the help of the Nereids, ascended the river to establish how far it was, to the west, its source. Gozman, for his part, considering the situation of the ships at his disposal too compromised to face who knows what situations continuing the journey to the south, resumed the road north, to return to Elensefar retracing the same route made the first leg, a route already known and so, in some sense, safer!\n"
"Admiral Abelardo Gozman managed to return to Elensefar, where he arrived in the late summer of 523 YW, and when he arrived he found honors and glory, but above all he found the astonishing news that his lieutenant Guberto Piegafetta had arrived in Weldyn a couple of months before.\n"
"Piegafetta, in fact, going up the Amber River (which we'll see later why it was so called), had discovered not only that the river was born from the Bitter Swamp, but it was also easily navigable almost to the swamp, at least for a small boat like the one he used to ascent it.\n"
"Piegafetta took with him two things that became of great importance for the wild lands crossed by the Amber River: the first was a certain number of pieces of golden amber that the nereids were used to finding among the pebbles in the bottom of their bay; the second thing was the news that the lands he had crossed were wild, uninhabited and, above all, not claimed by anyone."

"While the lack of a sovereignty over the wild lands immediately interested the reigning house of Wesnoth, the amber immediately interested the merchants of Soradoc. They established an outpost where the Amber River ceased to be navigable, and from the outpost began to send boats to the Nereids' Bay; the outpost soon became a prosperous town that was named Amoran.\n"
"Problems started soon with the amber trade: the orcs that lived between the Amber River and the forest of Lintanir didn't look favorably at all the traffic of Wesnothians boats along the river, and acted like the orcs are used to act in these cases. There were several victims on both sides, guerrilla raids, punitive expeditions and reprisals. In the end, when the revenues of amber traffic along the river had become insufficient to support the military expenses necessary to keep it alive, a compromise was reached with the orcs.\n"
"The orcs recognized the sovereignty of Wesnoth on the wilds between the Bitter Swamp and the eastern coasts of the continent, south of the Amber River, but Wesnoth had to guarantee the neutrality of the river, and both parties pledged to ban boats on the river of any kind and for any purpose. In 536 YW the same treaties were recognized as valid also by the newborn Northern Alliance.\n"
"Then a caravan route was established, a path which followed, more or less, the course of the Amber River through the Wild Lands, and the amber returned to arrive at Amoran, and from here into the whole kingdom of Wesnoth. Amoran experienced a long period of prosperity, becoming a town so important as to deserve the title of Capital of the wilds, until... fashion changed!"

"Wesnoth's nobles and rich grew tired of amber, and for their own delight, the vanity of their kind consorts, and the pleasure of their keen lovers, they began to prefer the multi-colored precious stones that the dwarves pulled out of their mountains, and that were gotten more easily and with fewer vicissitudes than the amber coming into their hands.\n"
"With the decline, and finally the cessation, of the traffic of the amber, Amoran also declined, as slowly and dignifiedly as an old lady. The population gradually decreased, the trades ended, the stone walls became too expensive to maintain, and where they collapsed they were replaced by wooden palisades. The garrison, once numerous, was reduced to a handful of soldiers, carefully chosen among those who, for lack of money and of rank, had fewer means to oppose the assignment of such a disagreeable destination. The cultivated fields became the only source of wealth of the inhabitants, and there was a thinning-out of the coins in circulation, and also the merchants thinned out.\n"
"The only element of the anthropological landscape not to suffer a dramatic decline were the brigands, who became, however, more desperate, and therefore more ferocious than before!\n"
"Amoran retained the title of capital, but was effectively subjected to the authority of the more important city of Soradoc, but Soradoc was far away, and Amoran was beyond the swamp, beyond the hills, beyond, above all, the interest of the Soradoc's authorities... so imagine how distant Amoran became from the interest of those who governed Weldyn.\n"
"The town, now reduced to a village, had become so unimportant that it wasn't affected by the great invasion of undead of 625 YW, even if it seemed to have been born in the nearby Eastmark Hills. That was a good thing, because, otherwise, in no way could Amoran have survived to those calamitous events! Instead it survived, and... another day, another time, the wind changed!"

Others would have despaired, and not wrongly, Glauco, instead realized that for a sergeant without a name and without money, as he was, that command could be the occasion of his life to make a name for himself!\n"
"He departed full of enthusiasm and arrived at his destination full of ideas, all unworkable, matured in two weeks of travel. As soon as he arrived, and after the initial discouragement that gave him the resigned appearance of the town and the miserable composition of the garrison placed under his command, he rolled up his sleeves and said to himself: I will show my worth, at the first occasion! After a few very long and very boring months, the opportunity finally presented itself, but it didn't have a beautiful face at all."

On the other hand, having claimed the reward on the head of Dadoc, the bold young man preferred to invest in lances, war archers, and armor, rather than spend that gold in ways more pleasant but, given the venture in which he had slipped, also less useful for keeping his head on his neck.

The Amber River was deep and navigable from the east coast of the continent to Amoran, but it also served as a border with the territories of the orcs, and the treaties stipulated with the Northern Alliance provided, to guarantee the security of the borders, that no boat could go up or down the river."
